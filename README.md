# FINAL 0x3 DESIGN PATTERNS

> Have you heard of design patterns? We hope so. And what about implementing many different ones within the same solution, yet still maintainable, without tight coupling any part of structure?

This time you'll have to make use of any design pattern, depending on your skills. It's up to you, whether you implement a structural, creational or behavioral one. Try creating at least one. If it's too easy, then manage to implement at least 2 different design patters within the same project/solution without tightly coupling architecture members.
